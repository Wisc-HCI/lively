| Property | Description |
| --- | --- | 
|`robot_model`|A set of information and properties of a robot|
|`vars`|A set of useful features within the optimization, including history, joint, and link information|
|`lower_bounds`|A vector representing the lower bounds in the optimization vector. This is derived from the robot base limits and joint limits|
|`upper_bounds`|A vector representing the upper bounds in the optimization vector. This is derived from the robot base limits, as well as joint limits|
|`objective_set`|A lookup table containing all of the current [`objectives`](../../Objectives/objective) in use|
|`max_retries`|The maximum number of randomly initialized rounds allowed for each invocation of [`solve`](../Methods/solve)|
|`max_iterations`|The number of maximum iterations per round within the optimization|

## Retriving current [`state`](../../state)
Returns the solution [`state`](../../state) from the last invocation of [solve](../Methods/solve)
