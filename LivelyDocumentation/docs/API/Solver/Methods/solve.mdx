# solving

The `Solver` class has a `solve` method that represents the core functionality of the Lively interface. At a high level, it returns a fully-filled [state](../../state) object and accepts the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- | 
|`goals`|A look-up table of [goal](../../Goals/goal) objects. The key of the look-up table should match with that of the objectives to which the goals are corresponded.|
|`weights`|A look-up table of floats, order corresponding to the order of the objectives. The key of the look-up table should match with that of the objectives to which the weights are corresponded.|
|`time`|The current time. If no liveliness objectives are used, this has no effect.|
|`shapes`|A list of [shape](../../shapes) objects.|
