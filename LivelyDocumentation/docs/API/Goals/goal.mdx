# Goals
There are a variety of different "goal" types that can be provided. Think of these as settings that you would like to achieve (e.g. a PositionMatch objective accepts a `Translation` goal). 

## Translation
The translation goal is used by the `PositionMatch`, `PositionMirroring`, and `OriginPositionMatch` objectives.

_python_
```python
goal = Translation(x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.5)
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {Translation:[1.0,0.0,0.5]}
```

## Rotation

The rotation goal is used by the `OrientationMatch`, `OrientationMirroring`, and `OriginOrientationMatch` objectives.

_python_
```python
goal = Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707)
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {Rotation:[0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707]} // [x, y, z, w] ordering
```

## Scalar

The scalar goal is used by the `JointMatch`, `JointMirroring`, `DistanceMatch`, `JointLiveliness`, and `RelativeMotionLiveliness` objectives.

_python_
```python
goal = 0.5
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {Scalar:0.5}
```

## Size

The size goal is used by the `PositionLiveliness`, `OrientationLiveliness`, `OriginPositionLiveliness`, and `OriginOrientationLiveliness` objectives.

_python_
```python
goal = Size(x:1.0,y:0.1,z:0.5)
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {Size:[1.0,0.1,0.5]}
```

## Ellipse

The ellipse goal is used by the `PositionBounding` objective.

_python_
```python
goal = Ellipse(
    translation=Translation(x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.4),
    rotation=Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707),
    size=Size(x:0.1,y:0.1,z:0.2)
)
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {Ellipse: {
    pose: {translation: [1.0,0.0,0.4], rotation: [0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707]}, // [x, y, z, w] ordering for quaternion
    size: [0.1,0.1,0.2]
}
```

## RotationRange

The rotation range goal is used by the `RotationBounding` objective.

_python_
```python
goal = RotationRange(
    rotation=Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707),
    delta=0.4
)
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {RotationRange: {
    rotation: [0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707], // [x, y, z, w] ordering for quaternion
    delta:0.4
}
```

## ScalarRange

The scalar range goal is used by the `JointBounding` objective.

_python_
```python
goal = ScalarRange(value=0.0,delta=0.4)
```

_javascript_
```javascript
let goal = {ScalarRange: {value:0.0,delta:0.4}
```
