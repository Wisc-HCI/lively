# Goals
There are a variety of different "goal" types that can be provided. Think of these as settings that you would like to achieve (e.g. a PositionMatch objective accepts a `Translation` goal). 

## Translation
The translation goal is used by the `PositionMatch`, `PositionMirroring`, and `OriginPositionMatch` objectives.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Translation:[1.0,0.0,0.5]}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Translation(x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.5);
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = Translation3::new(0.0,0.0,0.0);
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 


## Rotation

The rotation goal is used by the `OrientationMatch`, `OrientationMirroring`, and `OriginOrientationMatch` objectives.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Rotation:[0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707]} // [x, y, z, w] ordering
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707)
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = UnitQuaternion::from_quaternion(Quaternion::new(0.0,0.0,-0.7069999677447771,0.7072135784958345));
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## Scalar

The scalar goal is used by the `JointMatch`, `JointMirroring`, `DistanceMatch`, `JointLiveliness`, and `RelativeMotionLiveliness` objectives.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Scalar:0.5}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = 0.5
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = 0.5;
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## Size

The size goal is used by the `PositionLiveliness`, `OrientationLiveliness`, `OriginPositionLiveliness`, and `OriginOrientationLiveliness` objectives.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Size:[1.0,0.1,0.5]}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Size(x:1.0,y:0.1,z:0.5)
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = Vector3::new(1.0,0.1,0.5);
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 


## Ellipse

The ellipse goal is used by the `PositionBounding` objective.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Ellipse: {
    pose: {translation: [1.0,0.0,0.4], rotation: [0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707]}, // [x, y, z, w] ordering for quaternion
    size: [0.1,0.1,0.2]}}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Ellipse(
    translation=Translation(x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.4),
    rotation=Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707),
    size=Size(x:0.1,y:0.1,z:0.2)
  )
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let pose = Isometry3::from_parts(
            Translation3::new(
                0.0,

        );
  let goal = Ellipse::new(pose, Vector3::new(0.1,0.1,0.2));
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## RotationRange

The rotation range goal is used by the `RotationBounding` objective.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {RotationRange: {rotation: [0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707], // [x, y, z, w] ordering for quaternion
