# Goals
There are a variety of different "goal" types that can be provided. Think of these as settings that you would like to achieve (e.g. a [`PositionMatch`](../Objectives/matching) objective accepts a `Translation` goal). 

## Translation
A 3-vector representing coordinates that is used by the [`PositionMatch`](../Objectives/matching), [`PositionMirroring`](../Objectives/mirroring) objectives.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Translation:[1.0,0.0,0.5]}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Translation(x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.5);
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = Translation3::new(0.0,0.0,0.0);
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 


## Rotation

A Quaternion representing rotation that is used by the [`OrientationMatch`](../Objectives/matching), [`OrientationMirroring`](../Objectives/mirroring) objectives.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Rotation:[0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707]} // [x, y, z, w] ordering
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707)
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = UnitQuaternion::from_quaternion(Quaternion::new(0.0,0.0,-0.7069999677447771,0.7072135784958345));
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## Scalar

A float value that is used by the [`JointMatch`](../Objectives/matching), [`JointMirroring`](../Objectives/mirroring), [`DistanceMatch`](../Objectives/matching), [`JointLiveliness`](../Objectives/liveliness), and [`RelativeMotionLiveliness`](../Objectives/liveliness) objectives.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Scalar:0.5}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = 0.5
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = 0.5;
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## Size

A 3-vector representing scale of a 3D shape that is used by the [`PositionLiveliness`](../Objectives/liveliness), [`OrientationLiveliness`](../Objectives/liveliness), [`OriginPositionLiveliness`](../Objectives/liveliness) objectives.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Size:[1.0,0.1,0.5]}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Size(x:1.0,y:0.1,z:0.5)
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let goal = Vector3::new(1.0,0.1,0.5);
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 


## Ellipse

A structure designating a rotated ellipsoid, with `Translation`, `Rotation`, and `Size` components. The `ellipse` goal is used by the [`PositionBounding`](../Objectives/bounding) objective.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {Ellipse: {
    pose: {translation: [1.0,0.0,0.4], rotation: [0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707]}, // [x, y, z, w] ordering for quaternion
    size: [0.1,0.1,0.2]}}
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">

  ```py
  goal = Ellipse(
    translation=Translation(x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.4),
    rotation=Rotation(w:0.707,x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.707),
    size=Size(x:0.1,y:0.1,z:0.2)
  )
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value= "rust" label="Rust"> 

  ```rust
  let pose = Isometry3::from_parts(
            Translation3::new(
                0.0,

        );
  let goal = Ellipse::new(pose, Vector3::new(0.1,0.1,0.2));
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## RotationRange

A structure including a center `Rotation`, as well as a float value indicating allowed delta in radians from that rotation. The `RotationRange` goal is used by the [`RotationBounding`](../Objectives/bounding) objective.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {RotationRange: {rotation: [0.707,0.0,0.0,0.707], // [x, y, z, w] ordering for quaternion

            )),
        );
  let goal = RotationRange::new(rotation,0.4);
  ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> 



## ScalarRange

A structure including a center float value, and float value representing allowed delta from that value. The `ScalarRange` goal is used by the [`JointBounding`](../Objectives/bounding) objective.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

  ```js
  let goal = {ScalarRange: {value:0.0,delta:0.4}}
