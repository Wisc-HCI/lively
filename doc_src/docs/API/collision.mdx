# Collision



Lively implements the PROXIMA collision detection algorithm, which allows for time-efficient collision
and proximity detection for robots [^1]. The Collision Avoidance objective serves to utilize the data generated from this collision detection algorithm to prevent collisions. Lively employs a three-fold
approach to handling modeling collision objects. 

1. The first is input from the URDF during the initialization of the solver. This specification allows for the inclusion of four default types of shapes: [`boxes`](../API/Shapes/box),
[`capsules`](../API/Shapes/capsule), [`cylinders`](../API/Shapes/cylinder), and [`spheres`](../API/Shapes/sphere), and these shapes are automatically imported into the collision model when the URDF is parsed. For cross-platform and web-based reasons, mesh-based colliders are ignored during URDF import. 

2. The second approach allows additional
colliders to be specified during initialization, including the above
shapes and additionally convex hulls. These shapes can be attached
to any link in the robot, or the world, allowing for a second level
of support for collision specification. 

3. Finally, as an optional input
to the [`solve`](../API/Solver/Methods/solve) method, developers can provide a set of updates to
the collision model. Using an id-based approach, new colliders can
be added, and existing colliders can be moved or deleted. These
mechanisms enable the system to respond in real-time to new or
moving objects in the scene.

:::note
The output of collision detection is a set of [`ProximityInfo`](../API/Info/proximityInfo). 
Changing the position of the object in the environment will not change the `distance` parameter from [`ProximityInfo`](../API/Info/proximityInfo) if the distance between that object and the robot is outside the collision detection distance parameter `d_max` specified in [`collisionSettingInfo`](../API/Info/collisionSettingInfo).
