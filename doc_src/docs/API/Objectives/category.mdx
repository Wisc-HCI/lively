| --- | --- | 
| `Base` | Revolve around the fluidity of robot motion by limiting rapid changes and considering possible collisions between the links of the robot |
| `Bounding` | Limit the space within which joints can assume angles and links can move or be oriented | 
| `Matching` | Specify exact positions and orientations of links or angles of joints, while bounding behavior properties set limits |
| `Mirroring` | Allow users to mirror the current state of a link's position or orientation in a different link, or the current angle of one joint in another |
| `Liveliness` | Allow adding smooth, coordinated motion to joint angles or link positions/orientations |
| `Forces` | Proximating the physcial forces applied to the robot |
