# Mirroring

Mirroring objectives allow users to mirror the current state of a link's position or orientation in a different link, or the current angle of one joint in another.

| Objective | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position Mirroring | [`Translation`](../Goals/goal)  | Mirror the positions of two links with an optional offset |
| Orientation Mirroring |  [`Rotation`](../Goals/goal)   | Mirror the rotations of two links with an optional offset |
| Joint Mirroring|  [`Scalar`](../Goals/goal)  | Mirror the values of two joints with an optional offset |
