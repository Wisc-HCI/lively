# Liveliness

Liveliness Objectives allow adding smooth, coordinated motion to joint angles or link positions/orientations.

| Objective | Goals | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position Liveliness | [`size`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion to the position of a link |
| Orientaion Liveliness | [`size`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion to the rotation of a link |
| Joint Liveliness | [`scalar`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion to a joint directly |
| Relative Motion Liveliness | [`scalar`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion towards and away from |
