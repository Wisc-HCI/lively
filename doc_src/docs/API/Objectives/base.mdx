# Base

Base objectives revolve around the fluidity of robot motion by limiting rapid changes and considering possible collisions between the links of the robot.
There are 9 Base objectives list below. 

| Objective | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collision Avoidance | `Base` | Detect and avoid collision using PROXIMA alogorithm[^1] |
| Joint Limits | `Base` | Applies a cost to approaching the robotâ€™s joint limits |
| Velocity Minimization | `Base` | Prevent rapid joint movements |
| Origin Velocity Minimization | `Base` | Prevent rapid robot root movements |
| Acceleration Minimization | `Base` | Prevent rapid changes in joint speed |
| Origin Acceleration Minimization | `Base` | Prevent rapid changes in robot root speed |
| Jerk Minimization | `Base` | Add fluidity to robot movement along the joints |
| Origin Jerk Minimization | `Base` |  Add fluidity to robot movement within the Cartesian space of the origin |
| Smoothness Macro | `Base` | Combines each of the velocity, acceleration, and jerk minimization properties with normalized weights |
