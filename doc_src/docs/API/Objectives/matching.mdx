# Matching

Matching Objectives specify exact positions and orientations of links or angles of joints, while bounding behavior properties set limits.

| Objective | Goals | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position Match | [`Translation`](../Goals/goal)  | Control a link's position in space |
| Orientation Match | [`Rotation`](../Goals/goal) | Control a link's position in space |
| Joint Match | [`Scalar`](../Goals/goal) | Control a joint's value directly |
| Distance Match | [`Scalar`](../Goals/goal) | Specify the distance between two links in space |
