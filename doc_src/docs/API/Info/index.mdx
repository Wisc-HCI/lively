# Info
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

`Lively` provides a set of data structures as `Info` objects that contains diagnostic information and are returned from the [`solver`](../Solver/) as output.

:::note
The users are not expected to construct `Info` objects because they are output. However, the [`CollisionSettingInfo`](collisionSettingInfo) object can be constructed by the user to be fed into the `Solver` during [`initialization`](../Solver/initialization)
