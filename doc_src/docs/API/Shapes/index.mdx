There are 4 different Shape classes: [`Box`](./box), [`Sphere`](./sphere), [`Cylinder`](./cylinder), and [`Capsule`](./capsule). The `name` field is entirely for your own usage, and the `frame` field indicates what robot link the shape is attached to (by default "world"). The `physical` field indicates whether the shape presents a collision, and should be factored into collision avoidance. Otherwise, the shape is simply tracked in the state if close enough.

:::note
The coordinate system Lively is using has **z-axis** as the **up-axis** compare to the traditional coordinate system that has **y-axis** as the **up-axis**
