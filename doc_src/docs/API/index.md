# Overview



- The Lively framework provides a highly configurable toolkit for commanding robots in mixed modalities while incorporating liveliness motions. It is adapted from [RelaxedIK](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_core) framework, and compatible with Python and Javascript/Node.

- To configure a robot, the easiest method is to use the LivelyStudio interface in the [LivelyStudio](https://github.com/Wisc-HCI/LivelyStudio) repository, which is a system for configuring and programming the robot visually.

:::note
Since Lively is still in beta, the design is subject to change and should not be considered final!
