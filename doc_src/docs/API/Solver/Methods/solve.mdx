# Solving

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The `Solver` class has a `solve` method that represents the core functionality of the Lively interface. At a high level, it returns a fully-filled [`state`](../../state) object and accepts the following fields:
:::note
The **optional** field can be left empty if the no specification is needed. The `Solver` will just use the default values for the optional parameters.
:::

| Field          | Type                                                                | Optional | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `goals`        | look-up table of [`goal`](../../Goals/goal) indexed by a string key | no       | The key of the look-up table should match with that of the [`objectives`](../../Objectives) to which the `goals` are corresponded. |
| `weights`      | look-up table of float value indexed by a string key                | no       | The key of the look-up table should match with that of the [`objectives`](../../Objectives) to which the weights are corresponded. |
| `time`         | float                                                               | no       | The current time stamp. It is advised to always pass in a increasing time stamp for the solver to have a more consistent behavior. |
| `shape_update` | list of `ShapeUpdate` objects                                       | yes      | see below                                                                                                                          |

## Shape Update

The `shape_update` parameter in `solve` takes in a list of `ShapeUpdate` objects specifying the environmental shapes to be introduced, modified, and removed.
The `ShapeUpdate` object allows for three functionalities or types: `Add`, `Move`, and `Delete` each corresponding to the tasks mentioned above. For more information please see the example below.
:::note
The [`shape`](../../Shapes/) objects passed in the `shapes` parameter in `solver` [`initialization`](../initialization) are static and can not be moved or deleted later. Only the shapes that are introduced (`Add`) to the environment in `ShapeUpdate` can be moved or deleted by `Move` and `delete`.
:::

### Example for adding a new environmental shape

When a new shape is introduced to the environment, the `id` associated with the new shape needs to be unique.
The `id` will be used to identify the shape when a `Move` or `Delete` is performed on the same shape.
:::note
If another shape is added to the environment with the same `id`, the new shape will replace the old shape with the same `id`.

### Example for moving an existing environmental shape
:::note
If a wrong `id` is used, the solver will not change the transformation of any shape.

```js
const moveCube = [
  Move: {
    // This is a Move ShapeUpdate functionality or type. This modifies the transform of the Cube introduced by Add in the environment

    transform: {// the shape will be moved to this transformation
