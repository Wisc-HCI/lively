# Collision Normalization

[`Collision Detection`](../../collision) is a computational-heavy calculation that allows for collision and proximity detection for robots and environmental shapes. 
To help with the calculation, we have a method, `compute_average_distance_table` that normalizes the distance between the objects in the environment to enhance the performance of [`collision detection`](../../collision)
