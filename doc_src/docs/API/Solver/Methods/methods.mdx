# Methods

## Solving

The [`Solver`](../initialization) class has a `solve` method that represents the core functionality of the Lively interface. At a high level, it returns a fully-filled [state](../../state) object and accepts the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- | 
|`goals`|A look-up table of [`goal`](../../Goals/goal) objects. The key of the look-up table should match with that of the objectives to which the goals are corresponded.|
|`weights`|A look-up table of floats, order corresponding to the order of the objectives. The key of the look-up table should match with that of the objectives to which the weights are corresponded.|
|`time`|The current time. If no liveliness objectives are used, this has no effect.|
|`shapes`|A list of [`shape`](../../shapes) objects.|

## Resetting 

In both the Javascript and Python interfaces, the [`Solver`](../initialization) class has a `reset` method that allows the user to reset the state of the solver given some new objective weights and a new robot state. In this case, the robot state only needs to supply the `joints` and `origin` field, as shown in the initialization example.
