# Overview

:::note 
Since Lively is still in beta, the design is subject to change and should not be considered final!
:::

In this section, the examples of basic applications are demonstrated through Live Editor under the [`Basic Usage`](/lively/docs/category/basic-usage) section. The Live Editor contains a real-time code block that allows the developer to make changes. The corresponding effects of the changes will be reflected in the interactive playground under the code block. There are also `Javascript`, `Python`, and `Rust` codeblock demonstrating the examples. There are examples to show the developers how to extend and customize the `lively` system by creating addtional [`objectives`](../API/Objectives/) and [`goals`](../API/Goals/goal.mdx) under the [`Customized Usage`](/lively/docs/category/customized-usage) section.
