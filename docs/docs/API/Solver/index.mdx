# Solver

## Introduction
The `Solver` contains the core functionality of the `Lively` toolkit. 
You can think of it as a single entry point for specifying behaviors and receiving robot instructions. 

```mermaid

graph LR
    G[Goals] --> SFn{{solve}}
    G -.- O
    W[Weights] --> SFn
    T[Time] --> SFn
    C[Shapes] --> SFn
    subgraph Solver
    O[Objectives]
    SFn
    end
    subgraph S[State]
    SFn --> L[Link Transforms]
    SFn --> J[Joint Values]
    SFn --> P[Proximity]
    SFn --> M[Center of Mass]
    end
```

## Workflow

Generally, the usage of the solver involves a regular sequence of steps. 
To begin, the Solver is [`initialized`](./initialization) with a set of parameters, 
including the robot's URDF, a set of [`objectives`](../Objectives/), 
initial joint [`state`](../state), and a description of the collision environment.

It is optional, but advised, to then execute the [`compute_average_distance_table`](./Methods/collision_normalization) 
method to normalize the distances between links and the environment to improve the performance of the collision avoidance algorithm.
Note, if proximity information from a previous run that was normalized is provided as part of the initialization 
[`state`](../state), it will re-use the normalization calculated there. 

Finally, the solver's [`solve`](./Methods/solve) method can be run in a loop, such that each loop any change in goals 
is passed, and the new computed state is returned.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Initialize] -->|optionally| B(Compute Average Distances)
    A --> Solve
    B --> Solve
    Solve -->|in loop| Solve
```

In the following sections you will see how the solver is initialized, utilized, and structured.
