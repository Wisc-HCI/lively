# Base

Base objectives revolve around the fluidity of robot motion by limiting rapid changes and considering possible collisions between the links of the robot.
There are 9 Base objectives list below. 

| Objective | Goals | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collision Avoidance | none | Detect and avoid collision using PROXIMA alogorithm[^1] |
| Joint Limits | none | Applies a cost to approaching the robotâ€™s joint limits |
| Velocity Minimization | none | Prevent rapid joint movements |
| Origin Velocity Minimization | none | Prevent rapid robot root movements |
| Acceleration Minimization | none | Prevent rapid changes in joint speed |
| Origin Acceleration Minimization | none | Prevent rapid changes in robot root speed |
| Jerk Minimization | none | Add fluidity to robot movement along the joints |
| Origin Jerk Minimization | none |  Add fluidity to robot movement within the Cartesian space of the origin |
| Smoothness Macro | none | Combines each of the velocity, acceleration, and jerk minimization properties with normalized weights |
