# Liveliness

Liveliness Objectives allow adding smooth, coordinated motion to joint angles or link positions/orientations.

| Objective | Goals | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position Liveliness | [`size`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion to the position of a link |
| Orientaion Liveliness | [`size`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion to the rotation of a link |
| Joint Liveliness | [`scalar`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion to a joint directly |
| Relative Motion Liveliness | [`scalar`](../Goals/goal) | Add smooth motion towards and away from |

## Parameters for constructing Liveliness Objectives
|Parameter|Objectives|Type|Optional|Defauly value/behavior|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|all of the objectives mentioned above|string|no|none|Name can be arbitrary and should be unqiue|
|`weight`|all of the objectives mentioned above|float|no|none|Indicates the prioritization of the objective|
|`link`|`Position Liveliness`,`Orientation Liveliness`,|string|no|none|The name of the link this objective is applied to|
|`joint`|`Joint Liveliness`|string|no|none|The name of the joint the objective is applied to|
|`link1`|`Relative Motion Liveliness`|string|no|none|The name of the first link the objective is applied to|
|`link2`|`Relative Motion Liveliness`|string|no|none|The name of the second link the objective is applied to|
|`frequency`|all of the objectives mentioned above|float|no|none|A range higher than 0.0 and lower than 30.0 is advised. Higher the value, slower the lively-motion; lower the value, faster the lively-motion.|
