# Bounding

Bounding Objectives limit the space within which joints can assume angles and links can move or be oriented.

| Objective | Goals | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position Bounding | [`Ellipse`](../Goals/goal) | Place the position of a link within a rotated ellipsoid |
| Orientation Bounding | [`RotationRange`](../Goals/goal) | A region in orientation space with some delta around an orientation |
| Joint Bounding | [`JointBounding`](../Goals/goal) | Limits the maximum and minimum values of a given joint |
